    "NoSQL Databases:\n",

    "Non-relational: NoSQL databases are non-relational or distributed.\n",
    "Schema-less: They can store unstructured or semi-structured data and do not require a predefined schema.\n",
    "Scalability: Generally offer more scalability and flexibility than traditional SQL databases.\n",
